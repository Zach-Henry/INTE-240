    <h1>Linger by the Cranberries</h1>
    <hr>
<p>If you, if you could return<br>
Don't let it burn<br>
Don't let it <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fade">fade</a><br>
I'm sure I'm not being rude<br>
But it's just your attitude<br>
It's tearing me apart<br>
It's ruining every day<br>
<i>I swore, I swore I would be true<br></i>
And honey so did you<br>
So why were you holding her hand?<br>
Is that the way we stand?<br>
Were you lying all the time?<br>
Was it just a game to you?<br>
<strong><p>But I'm in so deep<br>
You know I'm such a fool for you<br>
You got me wrapped around your finger<br>
Do you have to let it linger?<br>
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it <a href="https://www.songfacts.com/lyrics/the-cranberries/linger">linger?</a></strong>
<p>Oh, I thought the world of you<br>
I thought nothing could go wrong<br>
But I was wrong, I was wrong<br>
If you, if you could get by<br>
Trying not to lie<br>
Things wouldn't be so confused<br>
And I wouldn't feel so used<br>
But you always really knew<br>
I just want to be with you</p>
<p><strong>And I'm in so deep<br>
You know I'm such a fool for you<br>
You got me wrapped around your finger<br>
Do you have to let it linger?<br>
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?</strong></p>
<p>And I'm in so deep<br>
You know I'm such a fool for you<br>
You got me wrapped around your finger<br>
Do you have to let it linger?<br>
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?<br>
You know I'm such a fool for you<br>
You got me wrapped around your finger<br>
Do you have to let it linger?<br>
Do you have to, do you have to, do you have to let it linger?<br></p>
